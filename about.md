# About Me
Hello! I am V.
I like monsters and hanging out with my friends because i love them and care for them and they care for me too. I wanna go into the army and hopefully get a job there either working on airplanes and tanks or driving them because I already have so much experience with
mechanical work and it'll be easy for me when i get the hang of it. it connects to my lifestyle because i already have experience on cars. Skills that'll help me are project management and communication.
